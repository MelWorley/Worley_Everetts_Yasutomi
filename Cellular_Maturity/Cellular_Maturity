# To create a gene signature of developmental progression / cellular maturity - we first looked for genes with differential expression during normal development
#(between mid and late 3rd instar)

# this set of genes is called "temporalGenes"

```{r}
temporalGenes = read.csv( file = "~/Epithelum_temporalGenes_265.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

temporalGenes = temporalGenes$x

# An example of a gene with differential expression during normal development: 

temporalGenes[temporalGenes == "br"]
```

# Next we ran PCA on the single-cell data only considering these temporal genes (using seurat) 

```{r}
CellularMaturity = RunPCA(Seurat_Object, features = temporalGenes )
DimPlot(CellularMaturity, reduction = "pca")
